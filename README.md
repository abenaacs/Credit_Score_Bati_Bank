# Project: Credit Risk Analysis with Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on credit risk analysis combined with fraud detection using structured datasets. The implementation leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, machine learning models, and API services for prediction. The modular design ensures scalability, reusability, and alignment with CI/CD workflows for better automation and maintainability.
