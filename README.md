# Project: Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze credit risk through data exploration, visualization, and modular Python scripts. By leveraging structured datasets, we compute essential metrics like default rates and use exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights into credit risk factors. The project structure supports scalability, reusability, and automation through CI/CD workflows and modular coding practices.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, compute essential statistics, and clean datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize distributions, correlations, and detect patterns.
- **Credit Risk Metrics**: Compute default rates and other credit risk-related metrics.
- **Reusable Modules**: Encapsulate functionality into reusable scripts.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate testing and linting using GitHub Actions.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abenaacs/Credit_Score_Bati_Bank.git
   cd Credit_Score_Bati_Bank
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running Scripts

- To calculate credit risk metrics, run:

  ```bash
  python scripts/credit_risk.py
  ```

- To use the EDA utilities, import them into your custom scripts or notebooks:
  ```python
  from scripts.eda import plot_distribution
  ```

### Jupyter Notebooks

- Open and execute the `notebooks/eda.ipynb` file for interactive exploratory data analysis:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb
  ```
