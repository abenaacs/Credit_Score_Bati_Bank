## Purpose

The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization. These notebooks serve as an interactive medium for understanding the data and its characteristics before implementation.

---

## Files

- `eda.ipynb`: Visualizes data distributions, correlations, and identifies patterns and anomalies.

---

## Usage

### Running the Notebook

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the desired notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb
   ```

4. Execute each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

### Modifying the Notebook

- Update the dataset path in the notebook to analyze custom datasets.
- Add visualizations and insights based on project-specific requirements.
